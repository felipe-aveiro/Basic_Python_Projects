## <b>Welcome to my <em>Turbomachinery</em> Project repository!</b>

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>About</b>
Here you will find materials from a Python project related to turbomachinery that I have completed during my academic journey in Mechanical Engineering.

In this assignment, I delved into the intricate analysis of various Thermodynamic Power Cycles, focusing on their specific work and thermodynamic efficiency. A typical Brayton cycle for an ideal gas encompasses 3 primary stages: compression, heat addition, and expansion. However, we extend the complexity of this cycle by incorporating additional steps to enhance either power output or thermodynamic efficiency.

The cycle under study introduces intercooling and recuperation to the simple Brayton cycle. Intercooling involves inserting another compression stage for the working fluid, along with an intercooler between these stages. This addition aims to decrease the specific work required to attain a higher pressure. Recuperation, on the other hand, entails recovering heat from the outlet of the expansion stage to aid the heat injection stage. This process reduces the amount of heat needed to be added, thereby boosting the thermodynamic efficiency.
